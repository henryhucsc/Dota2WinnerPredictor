First I tried putting the raw data into the apriori algorithm. 
This did not yeild any cohearent data as the number of possible values led to correlations being around 1/dataset size. 
I then split the data values under binary lines. I used fairly arbitary values. This gave some data, but it was noisy and gave few useful results. 
I then used the average value as my split indicator.Our data for match count and mmr do not have any relevence. 
To aid in reading, I have changed the stored values. The format is (index number)(1 or 0) 1 represents greater then average. 

Results: My algorithm has generated a few useful associations: Higher then average gold per minute implies higher xp per minute
I have split the results into low medium and high mmr groups. I am now going to sub divide them into sub groups to refine our mmr predictions
I have used a weighted average method to split them. KDA is the highest value, worth 2 points, everything else is worth 1. Each player is given a score
based on how far they are from the mean of their respective group.

Ex= Consider a player who is in the low mmr group. They have a kda of 2.33, A Gmp of 444 and a xpm of 400 and hero damage of 9100. 
Their score would equal (2.33)*2/(2.48)+(444)/413+400/346+9100/9080= 5.112. Since the mean value of x should be 5, this player is slightly above average for that elo block.
With more players, this process will become more refined. 
After splitting all of the users up I created a simple file combiner program to merge them into rmmr.csv

What each of the files do :  
data.csv contains the original player data
Data.txt Shows the average values of low, med and high mmr groups. 
elosplitter.py is the script I have been using to split the players based on elo
filecombiner.py is a file combiner to consolodate csv files. 
The rest of the csv files are middle level files used to create rmmr.csv, the revised mmr files. 
Log is a description of my efforts. 

Todo: Make slides, Get more player files to improve numbers.
